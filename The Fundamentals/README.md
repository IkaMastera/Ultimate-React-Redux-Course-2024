# What you have learned so far

1. What is react used for and what problems does it solve, this is a great one because i understand fundamentally what react does and what is it made for in its name it reacts to user changes in the UI and reacts accordingly. it solves the problem of having 3 seperate files for logic, structure and styles and uses JSX to solve this problem, its easier to style and structure the components when all of the styles and structure and logic are in 1 file.
2. props: props are reacts way to pass data from a parent to child components and in this way it allows for more dynamic data manipulation and component structuring, as i learned react is using one-way-data-flow which means that data is allways flowing from parent components to child components to compare Angular is using two-way-data-flow but react is better in this way because its easier to debug and predict where the data is coming from, its much faster and easier to understand for developers also i learned that props are immutable and as my understanding goes its a fundamentall thing in react to remember you never change data from a child component outside of its braces hope this makes sence in future :D.
3. Event Handlers and how we can manage states in react and what is states in react this topic was really hard for me from the beggining but i'm really getting a hang of it from this course, event handlers in react are used more in a declarative way than imperative like in javascript which means we don't manually select elements from dom but instead we tell the react directly in the JSX what we want event we want that specific element to handle.
   state is reacts way of keeping good track of data that user changes in our UI
   it rerenders the specific view that user is interacting with and changes its data accordingly, I would say that State is like a hearth in our components lifecycle it pumps blood(data) into our component and changes The UI.
4. Moved forward with state managment and state flow in react i will try to explain this as i remembered to so we have this kind of flow: will data change at some point -> YES -> then question can be computed by already existin state/prop -> NO Should iT rerender the component ? -> YES -> Place new state in component -> data is only used inside of this component ? -> YES -> Leave inside component -> data is also used by child component ? -> YES -> Pass the data with props from parent to child component -> data is used by one or a few sibling component ? -> YES -> uplift the state to the nearest parent component. i would describe the flow as this also if the data will not change at some point then we should use regular const -> also if data can be computed by already existing state/prop -> we should derive that data from that state. also if data should not rerender the component then we should use useRef.
