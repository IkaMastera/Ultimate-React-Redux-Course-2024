# What you have learned so far

1. What is react used for and what problems does it solve, this is a great one because i understand fundamentally what react does and what is it made for in its name it reacts to user changes in the UI and reacts accordingly. it solves the problem of having 3 seperate files for logic, structure and styles and uses JSX to solve this problem, its easier to style and structure the components when all of the styles and structure and logic are in 1 file.
2. props: props are reacts way to pass data from a parent to child components and in this way it allows for more dynamic data manipulation and component structuring, as i learned react is using one-way-data-flow which means that data is allways flowing from parent components to child components to compare Angular is using two-way-data-flow but react is better in this way because its easier to debug and predict where the data is coming from, its much faster and easier to understand for developers also i learned that props are immutable and as my understanding goes its a fundamentall thing in react to remember you never change data from a child component outside of its braces hope this makes sence in future :D.
