## Introduction
> Building a Pure React app for practice without a build tool

## What I Learned
> It's a really bad idea to use pure react for production because of its many flaws in UI rendering and manual reloading of the page
that problems disappears with React.js which automatically reloads and re-renders the page as user makes changes to the UI
that's what I got out of this section.
